# 100 Days of Blender

This repository holds the `.blend` files and other assets for ~100 creative 3D modeling and animation projects created over roughly 100 Days.

## Why?
I started lifting weights for no particular reason one day. It has since become a habit and now I am very strong. I would like to become stronger at computer graphics and I am hoping to apply the same method of "doing it most every day" and seeing similar results. If you're hiring, call me!

## Individual Projects
Projects follow no particular pattern and inspiration for them takes many forms. For example: a project could be following or riffing on a tutorial, a design revealed to me in prophetic dream, or something that I think will make my partner smile. Each project contains a `note.md` that provides some context for the inspiration, assets, goals, and my reflections on the work.
There should be one top level `.blend` file per 'Day' Directory which you can use to see the work.
The `Final/` directory holds a `.png` and/or `.mp4` of the final scene/animation.
