# Day #01

Today's project went much better than the previous. I am frequently inspired to draw/paint/_render_ my partner as a frog for reasons I am legally obliged to leave unexplained, and today was no exception.

I had the vision of a felted frog, simplified chibi-esque character. It would be within my talents to model such a stubby body, and the felt look would make it endearing and similar to some felted stuffed frogs we have around the apartment. The modeling was fun, with some simple extrusions, scalings, squashings, and subdivision modifiers I ended up with something closely matching my mind's eye which was very gratifying as opposed to what I experienced the day prior.

Instead of felted-felting (?), I went with a needle-felted look to the chap. I am a complete n00b when it comes to using Blender's hair particle system, so I followed [this tutotial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr7UaL7tMMw) which helped _a lot_. It took some tweaking, both to the hair settings, and to the model to make the shapes and colors easily distinct from each other, which is important for such a stylized character. Despite all the time I spent in hair particle system, it is still largely a mystery to me and I should do a deeper dive one day to learn how it formally works.
