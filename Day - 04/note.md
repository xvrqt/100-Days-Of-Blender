# Day #04

This project is, well, not my best. I am only proud that I still made time for it and kept on track for my 100 Days of Blender. It was supposed to be a rabbit with a some fabric textures and soft body physics. It's, well, as you can see it's like 5% of the way there.

Here are my excuses:

1. HOA emergencies & work (see previous post) took up my time
2. Election night and my attention and energies were else where
3. I was using Blender on my laptop
4. I couldn't use Waypipe (broken for some reason I failed to debug) so I had to use my shitty CPU for Blender
5. Election Night so I was also drinking several ciders

Welp. I guess my father was right about me. A disappointment in truth.
