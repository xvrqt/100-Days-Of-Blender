# Day #00

Ahhh the beginning. It has been quite a while since I did any 3D modeling, and I was never very proficient to begin with so the question of "what to make" was more of a struggle than anticipated. I hate spending time waffling because it's often much less time efficient then starting and starting again when you realize how much you picked the wrong place to start. So, where better to start than at the beginning? I loaded the very first Blender tutorial I had ever done, building a Minecraft textured pillared structure on a floating patch of dirt.

## Smiley Meteor
I quickly rebuilt it, and it felt as pointless as I did dejected. The only change I made was to the marble texture, making it more "physically based" instead of "Minecraft". I also had a flaming smiley face knock all my pillars down which proved extremely frustrating as my simulation kept breaking and crashing and eventually I settled for something decidedly low resolution :[

Oh well. It did spur me to try my hand at something more though. So, on Day Zero we already have a "2-for-1 Special"

## Floating Tree
After somehow feeling both under _and_ overwhelmed by my first project, I decided to try my hand at some modeling, and sculpting of all things. I had the vision of a tree floating in space on a small patch of dirt. A peaceful scene, perhaps set to some lo-fi. This projects is a such a mishmash of things. I start with a stylized look, but the dirt ended up overly PBR feeling and complicated. I spread the rocks out using Geometry Nodes for some reason, which took more time to setup, and made the final result look worse than had I just hand placed a few. I also used the nodes to make the rocks themselves. The fireflys are a particle system Boid-swarm. The grass and dirt are sculpted (something I have absolutely no experience with). The entire piece is in conflict with itself and decidedly amateur. It is the painful gap between one's artistic sensibilities and their skill level rendered in Cycles for 144 frames. That said, I think this was me "stretching out" - reminding myself of all the tools afforded by Blender and poking through them certainly poked some synapses back together in the process.
