# Day #03

This project was hastily thrown together because I spent most of the day working on, well, work. Despite not having an income for two years, it seems I owe the IRS a lot of money so I'm doing some freelance consulting to earn enough so they don't seize my home. Where would my cats live ;\_\_;

Anyways, this did allow me to test out two new tools:

1. Kiri - 3D Scanner App
2. Omniscient - 3D Video Tracking & Mesh Generation

I used Kiri to scan in the crystal you see there. It works extremely well and the app is a joy to use. I really wish we weren't in the stage of capitalism where all apps require a subscription to use or I would definitely buy it (once, for a fixed fee). The model and texturing was really nice and if I had more time I would spend all of it on the crystal's texture so that the crystal parts more accurately transmit and reflect light. Fortunately, at the distance it's held in the film it's hard to tell that the texturing is very basic.

Omniscient still doesn't make a lot of sense to me, and it took three tries to get a video of the pumpkins that "worked" - but it's also very easy to use and I love the auto setup of Blender's compositing tab to map the video on the scene.

So I added a scanned object, to a scanned video. I guess this is my first foray to VFX. If I had more time I would have used a different object, or textured the crystal more convincingly. If I had more time I would have recorded a video that wasn't as random and meandering. With the time I had I am glad I learned two new tools, and stitched them together to create the world's most boring and randumb vfx shot.
