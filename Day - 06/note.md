# Day #06

Another vfx project, and another rushed day due to having to "work" for a living. This one features the same procedurally generated articulated tentacles as yesterday, but inserted into some footage I took while visiting Alcudia, Spain. As usual, I spent way too much time trying to get a smoke simulation to work and look good. I was hoping to have the tentacles "ink" the camera as it walked by (like a squid might). Alas, Blender crashed and my file was messed up and I was too much of a lazy baby to try to review my incremental files to salvage it. Instead you get a little volume absorption box.

What I would do differently is, as usual, find the time to make a video shot match the vfx I am adding to the scene for a more coherent final video. I would also fix all the clipping issue and work on making good looking smoke without spending hours on re-baking it to try out new ideas.
