# Day #05

I was pretty happy with how today went, and ended up building procedurally generated, articulated tentacles using geometry nodes. In addition, the tentacles will try to grab a ball, and I practiced sending geometry node attributes to shader nodes to change their appearance when the ball is too close. I was also pleased at my 3D figure eight path the comet zooms around. I am getting a lot more proficient at curve manipulation.

I think I could improve in several areas. The first is that I learned you cannot make a comet follow a curve and also deform to a curve. This is very strange to me. Oh well. The second is that the modeling of the tentacles little spinal column analogues was pretty lack luster. I need to work on my modeling skills, because making some interesting hard body triangle model is a skill that I'd like to possess.
